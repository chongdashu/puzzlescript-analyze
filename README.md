PuzzleScript Analyze
====================

An experimental research project looking into some interesting characteristics of [PuzzleScript](http://www.puzzlescript.net) games.

This is some pretty early stage work, so there isn't anything particularly interesting at this point. Currently, the first couple of steps involve getting a [Python](http://www.python.org) script to parse the PuzzleScript files.
